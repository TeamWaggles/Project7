# Neightborhood-Map - React Project

This project uses the map API from Google along with the location and address API from Foursquare. The map application displays a list that shows each attraction on the map. A search bar is provided in order to filter the location and map icon.


## Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. You can find more information on how to perform common tasks here.

- Use npm install in order to install the proper dependecies (Be careful not to install dependecies globally)
- Make sure that the dependecies are located in the proper section with the package.json file
- Git clone the file
- Start the development server with npm start
- Once running the application will display a map with markers along with a search bar that will filter the markers
- Each marker will show it's title and address when clicked on.
